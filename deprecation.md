{: #migration-options-fortigate-10g}

FortiGate Security Appliance 10 Gbps is expected to reach end of support on 31 December 2026. To keep your network secure and avoid any business disruptions, we recommend planning your migration well before the end of support date.

The following alternatives help you migrate to a suitable firewall offering:

1. Recommended option:
   * Migrate to the Fortinet Virtual Firewall (vFSA). See [Getting started with vFSA](/docs/vfsa?topic=vfsa-getting-started-vfsa) and [license types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vfsa?topic=vfsa-getting-started-vfsa#choosing-vfsa-license).
   * Use Forti-Converter Service that is included in the enterprise license to migrate security policies and configurations from Fortinet hardware to the Fortinet virtual appliance.
      * Register an account in the [FortiConverter Service](https://service.forticonverter.com/){: external} for customer self-managed service.
      * For help with creating a migration ticket, see the [Forti-Converter Service Ticket Guide](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/forticonverter-service/25.1.0/online-help/783478/create-forticonverter-service-ticket){: external}.
1. Other virtual firewall options:
   * Juniper vSRX with Content Security Bundle: Enhanced security features, VLAN protection, HA configurations, IPS/IDS/UTM capabilities. See [Getting started with Juniper vSRX](/docs/vsrx?topic=vsrx-getting-started-vsrx).
   * Virtual Router Appliance (VRA 5600): Enterprise router with firewall, VPN, traffic shaping, and policy-based    routing. See [Getting started with Virtual Router Appliance](/docs/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-getting-started-vra).

Contact [IBM Cloud Support](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/support){: external} for any guidance or to know more about the migration process.
